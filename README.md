## Translator App

This is a simple Flask-based translator app that uses Meta's yorickvp/llava-13b on Replica to translate short text between multiple languages. 
I built it to test out model integration and keep the UI clean and usable. 
It supports RTL languages, enforces a word limit, and includes copy-to-clipboard functionality.

## Features

* Translate between 14+ languages
* Word limit (50 words) to keep things fast and cost-efficient
* Right-to-left support for languages like Arabic and Hebrew
* Copy icon with hover effect for clarity
* Responsive layout with auto-resizing text areas
* Built with Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, and Replicate API
