# Translator App

This is a lightweight, Flask-based translator app built in Python, designed to test out AI model integration and rapid deployment workflows.
It uses Metaâ€™s yorickvp/llava-13b model via the Replicate API, allowing short text to be translated across multiple languages with minimal latency.
The app was up and running locally within hours, thanks to a clean architecture and focused prototyping. It supports right-to-left (RTL) languages, 
enforces a word limit to keep model responses efficient, and includes copy-to-clipboard functionality for streamlined user interaction.
